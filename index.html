											<h2>Daniel Brunelle</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello! I'm Daniel, creator and primary bookkeeper of Paridot Bookkeeping. I am a QuickBooks ProAdvisor, but I also have a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science, and I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce in accounting to enhance and possibly expand my professional services.
											<p>After several years finding and creating work in the video game development industry as a coder and business manager, I discovered that I love the business and finance side of things a lot more than front line operations of a business. When I started my first corporation, the most satisfying part for me was working to make sure the books were clean and easy to read. I wanted to do that more than I wanted to actually run the business! It took me a while to realize this, but once I did, I decided to become a professional bookkeeper. My goal is to share that skill with people who just want to run their business with the peace of mind that their books are in great hands.
