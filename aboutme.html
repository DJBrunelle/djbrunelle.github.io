							<h1>Daniel Brunelle</h1>
							<p>Programmer passionate about making games</p>
						</header>

						<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
						<p>

							Hello! I'm Daniel, a passionate and driven game developer on a quest to create
							immersive and enjoyable gaming experiences. My journey into the world of game development
							began at a young age when I marveled at the vast and captivating landscapes of games like
							RuneScape. I couldn't help but wonder how these intricate worlds were brought to life within
							a web browser.
						</p>

						<p><strong>Educational Background:</strong></p>

						<p>
							I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Business, providing me with
							a strong foundation in both the technical and entrepreneurial aspects of the industry. I
							incorporated Paridot Games in October of 2022, and have since been awarded $15,000 in
							funding, have made several YouTube videos on behalf of the company, and participated in
							several projects.
						</p>

						<p><strong>Technical Proficiencies:</strong></p>

						<p>
							My skill set includes a deep understanding of programming languages such as C++ and C#,
							along with hands-on experience with popular game development tools like Unity. I'm
							well-versed in version control using Git and proficient in project management tools that
							ensure smooth development processes. I've also implemented key design principles, including
							the observer pattern, command pattern, and singletons, to create efficient and engaging game
							systems. Moreover, I have a firm grasp of game loops, update methods, and event queues.
						</p>
						

						<p><strong>Exprience and Leadership:</strong></p>

						<p>
							
							As a game developer, I have taken on leadership roles in numerous game jams, guiding teams
							to success and ensuring the completion of games with complete and compelling gameplay loops.
							I've also created informative YouTube tutorials on niche programming topics, sharing my
							knowledge with others in the game development community.
						</p>

						<p><strong>Passion for Building and Simulation Games:</strong></p>

						<p>
							My favorite games, including Satisfactory, RuneScape, Kerbal Space Program, and Minecraft,
							reflect my passion for simulation and building experiences. I consistently strive to
							incorporate crafting and building mechanics into my projects, although I acknowledge the
							challenges of managing scope in such ambitious endeavors.
						</p>

						<p><strong>Community Involvement:</strong></p>

						<p>
							I'm an active member of the game development community, with a special dedication to the
							non-profit organization GameCamp Edmonton. I've volunteered at events, including
							representing the organization at out-of-town conventions like Gamecon Canada. Regularly
							attending keynotes and networking events keeps me informed about industry trends and fosters
							valuable connections.
						</p>

						<p><strong>Commitment to Learning:</strong></p>

						<p>
							I'm constantly evolving my skill set and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends
							and technologies. When faced with new challenges or opportunities, I make it a point to
							dedicate time to learning and often share my newfound knowledge through informative YouTube
							videos.
						</p>

						<p><strong>Mission and Vision:</strong></p>

						<p>
							Ultimately, my mission as a game developer is to bring joy to people through my creations,
							much like the joy that games have brought to me over the years. I'm excited to continue my
							journey, develop captivating games, and share them with players around the world.
	
							Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio, and I look forward to the exciting
							adventures that lie ahead in the world of game development.
