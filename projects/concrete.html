					<h3>Project Overview</h3>

					<p>
						The Floor is Concrete was the result of a 72 hour game jam where the theme was
						"Positive/Negative" and it also had a special object which was "leaf". The game is an endless
						runner where the objective is to use your leafblower to keep
						a leaf from touching the ground or any obstacles in the way, and you need to get as far as
						possible.
					</p>

					<h3>Development Notes</h3>
					<p>
						We were a team of 3, with a 3D modeler, a level designer, and me, the programmer.
					</p>
					<p>

						As the programmer, I had a lot of fun and spent a lot of time making the wind effect from the
						leafblower. It was kind of challenging to come up with an efficient way to handle wind, but
						eventually landed on shooting raycasts randomly and constantly in a cone at the end of the
						leafblower.
						Although it may not have been the most resource efficient way to do it, it ended up working
						fairly well. The visual effects were a similar challenge, but I decided to just dynamic draw
						lines along the raycasts which seemed to give enough feedback to make it fairly intuitive.

					</p>

					<p>
						The time limit forced me to wrap up the wind effect, as it ended up taking more than a full day
						to get that feature to the point of usability. Other key parts I spent a lot of time on was
						getting the game loop to make sense, as well as visual interpolations with the camera to make
						everything feel smooth.
					</p>



					<h3>My Reflections</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Building the game in 1920x1080 resolution for the web was a mistake. It is very cumbersome
							to play the game when the resolution inside the web browser is as large as the screen.
							Fullscreen helps with this, but it's just not a great UI within itch.io
						</li>
						<li>
							Although I really enjoyed the time I spent building the wind system, I should have structure
							my time a bit better. We were really grinding towards the end to try to get everything
							finished
							in time. In the future, I will prioritize finiishing the game loop as quickly as possible,
							then building feature on top of that.
						</li>
