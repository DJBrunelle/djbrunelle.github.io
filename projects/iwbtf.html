						<h2>I Want to be the First</h2>
					</header>


					<h3>Project Overview</h3>

					<p>
						I Wanna be the First is the result of a 72 hour game jam which had 3 themes: "120 Seconds",
						"Transition", and "Slam". We tried to incorporate all of the themes, and came up with a
						Platformer which had a time limit of 120 seconds, and the objective of the game was to get to
						the end of the map and SLAM the like button on the computer. To navigate the obstacles, there
						was a transition mechanic where you had to transition between a 2D and 3D perspective based on
						the types of obstacles in front of you.
					</p>

					<h3>Development Notes</h3>
					<p>
						We were a team of three: a 3D modeler, Level Designer, and me as the programmer.
					</p>

					<p>
						My favourite part about this project was the transition mechanic. It worked similarly to my 2.5D
						Puzzle prototype, but instead of transitioning between two different 2D perspectives, this was
						between 2D and 3D.
					</p>

					<p>
						I also spent a considerable amount of time working on the player controller, and despite my best
						efforts, the time constraint forced me to leave it feeling a bit clunky and not super responsive
						around the edges of the platforms. It did give me a lot of knowledge on how to better approach
						player controllers in the future though.
					</p>

					<p>
						This was the first project I implemented my own method of using the new input system, and it
						worked flawlessly as far as I tested. You were able to seamlessly switch between controller and
						keyboard, and it was very well organized in the code.
					</p>
