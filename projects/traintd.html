						<h2>Train Tower Defense</h2>
					</header>

					<h3>Project Overview</h3>

					<p>
						TrainTD is similar to a Tower Defense game like BloonsTD, but instead of placing towers on a map
						around a road, you are in control of a train that has the towers as train carts moving along a
						train track.
						Your job is to build up the train and fight off enemies trying to attack the train and steal the
						money you are collecting.
						The progression of the game works similarly to Age of War, where you start in the "sticks and
						stones" era, and slowly work your way up through medieval era, modern era, futuristic, etc.
					</p>

					<h3>My Roles and Contributions</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Producer</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Helped make final calls on decisions and made my best efforts to pave the path for the
								game.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Lead Developer</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Wrote most of the code for the game (systems for the train, store, stats, enemy, etc.)
							</li>
							<li>Set up the development pipeline</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>


					<h3>Development Notes</h3>
					<p>
						This has been one of the larger projects I have worked on, and it's been very satisfying putting
						together elaborate systems that are well designed and work together seamlessly.
					</p>
					<p>
						Building the train mechanics was a highlight of this project, and I covered this in depth in one
						of my YouTube videos.
					</p>
					<p>
						A large part of this project was developing all of the most important systems and how they would
						communicate with eachother. I spent several days planning this out, and caught a planning
						session in a timelapse.

					<h3>My Reflections</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							As one of my larger projects, learning how to manage code and assets as they grow was a
							lesson I learned along the way. As we added new assets almost daily, it started getting hard
							to remember where everything was. This resulted in changing the project hierarchy a couple
							time as we progressed through the project. Even with more thoughtful organization, a large
							project will be inherently difficult to navigate, and trade offs will always be needed.

						</li>
						<li>
							Managing a group of people requires very clear communication, and agreed upon processes.
							This was this groups first time working on a longer term project, and there were constant
							improvements we needed to make in order for things to work well. Git best practices had to
							be agreed upon, everyone had to be kept up to date on the vision of the game, tasks and
							dependencies needed to be managed, and much more. This was a difficult but very helpful
							learning experience
						</li>
						<li>
							Having a more hasty prototyping phase could be helpful in the future. We spent several
							months on this prototype before we came to the conclusion that it would be difficult to turn
							what we're making into a full game that was fun to play and had clear objectives. Although I
							am very happy with the experience I gained from this project, it would be much more
							efficient going forward if we didn't put so much work into polishing a game before we know
							for sure that it will be a game we want to complete.
						</li>
					</ul>
